          The label layout component provides a mechanism for arranging child
          components based on their rectangular bounding boxes. It is typically
          used to render labels on maps or charts. A layout strategy is passed
          to the component in order to arrange the child rectangles avoiding
          collisions or remove overlaps.

          ```javascript

          var labelPadding = 2;


          // the component used to render each label

          var textLabel = fc.textLabel()
            .padding(labelPadding)
            .value(function(d) { return d.properties.name; });

          // a strategy that combines simulated annealing with removal

          // of overlapping labels

          var strategy = fc.removeOverlaps(fc.greedy());


          // create the layout that positions the labels

          var labels = fc.label(strategy)
              .size(function(d) {
                  // measure the label and add the required padding
                  var textSize = d3.select(this)
                      .select('text')
                      .node()
                      .getBBox();
                  return [textSize.width + labelPadding * 2, textSize.height + labelPadding * 2];
              })
              .position(function(d) { return projection(d.geometry.coordinates); })
              .component(textLabel);

          // render!

          svg.datum(places.features)
               .call(labels);
          ```

          *fc*.**label**(*strategy*)


          Constructs a new label layout with the given *strategy*. The label
          layout creates an array of rectangle bounding boxes which are passed
          to the strategy, which will typically move the boxes in order to
          minimise overlaps. Once the layout is complete a data join is used to
          construct a containing `g` element for each item in the bound array,
          and the component supplied to the layout is 'call'-ed on each element.


          Each `g` element has the following properties set:

           - `layout-width`, `layout-height` - the width and height of this label, as provided by the `size` property.
           - `display` - set to `inherit` or `hidden`, based on whether the strategy has hidden this label.
           - `anchor-x`, `anchor-y` - the original label location in relative coordinates to the this `g` element.


          *label*.**size**(*accessor*)


          Specifies the size for each item in the associated array. The
          *accessor* function is invoked exactly once per datum, and should
          return the size as an array of two values, `[width, height]`. The
          *accessor* function is invoked with the datum, and index. This
          function is invoked after the component has been rendered, and the
          value of the *this* context is the containing `g` element. As a
          result, you can measure the size of the component if the contents are
          dynamic, for example, measuring the size of a text label.


          *label*.**position**(*accessor*)


          Specifies the position for each item in the associated array. The
          *accessor* function is invoked exactly once per datum, and should
          return the position as an array of two values, `[x, y]`.


          *label*.**component**(*component*)


          Specified the component that is used to render each label.
      - title: Strategy
        level: 2
        content: >
          The label component uses a strategy in order to re-locate labels to
          avoid collisions, or perhaps hide those that overlap.


          The strategy is supplied an array of objects that describe the initial
          location of each label, as obtained via the `position` and `size`
          properties of `layout`.


          Each object has the following structure:


          ```

          {
              hidden: ...,
              x: ...,
              y: ...,
              width: ...,
              height: ...,
          }

          ```


          The strategy should return an array of objects indicating the
          placement of each label.


          ### Greedy


          The greedy strategy is a very fast way of reducing label overlap. It
          adds each label in sequence, selecting the position where the label
          has the lowest overlap with already added rectangles and is inside the
          container.


          *fc*.**greedy**()


          Constructs a greedy strategy.


          *greedy*.**bounds**(*array*)


          Optionally specifies a bounding region, as an array of two values,
          `[width, height]`. The strategy will try to keep labels within the
          bounds.


          ### Simulated Annealing


          The simulated annealing strategy runs over a set number of iterations,
          choosing a different location for one label on each iteration. If that
          location results in a better result, it is saved for the next
          iteration. Otherwise, it is saved with probability inversely
          proportional with the iteration it is currently on. This helps it
          break out of local optimums, hopefully producing better output.
          Because of the random nature of the algorithm, it produces variable
          output.


          *fc*.**annealing**()


          Constructs an annealing strategy.


          *annealing*.**bounds**(*array*)


          Optionally specifies a bounding region, as an array of two values,
          `[width, height]`. The strategy will try to keep labels within the
          bounds.


          *annealing*.**temperature**(*integer*)


          *annealing*.**cooling**(*integer*)


          The *temperature* parameter indicates the initial 'number' to use for
          the random probability calculation, and *cooling* defines the delta of
          the temperature between iterations. The algorithm runs for
          `Math.ceil(temperature / cooling)` iterations.


          ### Remove overlaps


          This strategy doesn't re-position labels to reduce overlaps, instead
          it removes overlapping labels. This is performed iteratively, with the
          labels that have the greatest area of overlap removed first.


          *fc*.**removeOverlaps**(*strategy*)


          Constructs a removeOverlaps strategy, adapting the supplied *strategy*
          in order to remove overlaps after it has been executed.
      - title: Text Label
        level: 2
        content: >
          This is a simple component that renders a label:


          ![d3fc label layout](textLabel.png)


          This component uses the `layout-width` and `layout-height` properties
          of its parent element to set its own width and height. It also uses
          the `anchor-x` and `anchor-y` properties to place the circular anchor.
          These properties are all set by the label layout as described above.


          *fc*.**textLabel**()


          Constructs a text label component.


          *textLabel*.**labelPadding**(*number*)


          Specifies the padding around the text.


          *textLabel*.**value**(*accessor*)


          Specifies the text rendered by this label as an accessor function.
